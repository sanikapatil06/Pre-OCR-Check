In the ever-evolving metaverse, the need for digitising text documents and extracting their essential data is becoming more crucial. However, the quality of these documents can often be poor, resulting in low-quality Optical Character Recognition (OCR) data and poor document intelligence extraction. The solution to this is to automatically determine the quality of these documents before they are processed through OCR and other processing methods.

## Goals
- The goal is to assess the quality of the documents and determine if they are
fit to undergo OCR and further processing using computer vision, image
processing methods, and machine learning models, or any other solution
that provides the best outcome.
- Participants will be provided with a set of text documents in English that
vary in size, colour, format, and quality.
- The solution should classify the documents into three categories: GOOD,
MODERATE, and POOR, based on the accuracy of OCR text (including
numbers and special characters) from engines like Google Vision or AWS
Textract.
- Document quality classes are defined as:<br>
GOOD - >= 95% accuracy<br>
MODERATE - 88 to 95%<br>
POOR - below 88%<br>

## Target Audience:
In the metaverse, reducing computational wastage is crucial for industries like
banking, manufacturing, healthcare, government administration bodies, and
more, where the demand for intelligent document processing software is high.

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Accuracy: The accuracy of the solution should be >= 80%, meaning at least 8
out of 10 documents should be classified correctly.
